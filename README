This directory contains the 0.1 release of the hostfilter NSS module.

For general building and installation instructions, see the file INSTALL.

The hostfilter NSS module provides a Name Service Switch module that resolves
blacklisted hostnames to a dummy IP address (192.168.2.254 as of now). It will
return 'notfound' on non-blacklisted hostnames allowing further modules
(configured in nsswitch.conf) to resolve them. For more information on NSS (Name
Service Switch), please consult the GNU C Library manual.

The decision about blocking the name resolution of a specific host name is done
by an external program (hostfilter helper) that is to be provided by the user or
some 3rd party application. This way the actual logic of blacklisting hosts can be provided flexibly. The path to this executable is configured in

   /etc/hostfilter.conf

The configuration file contains only one line with the full path to the
executable.
The hostfilter helper program must be executable by any user potentially using
the host filtering mechanism. If the hostfilter helper is not specified or can
not be executed, name resolution is allowed (along with outputting some
diagnostic message on stderr).
If hostfilter helper is successfully executed and returns 0, name resolution is
allowed. Otherwise it is denied.

In order to use the module, add the `hostfilter' service to
your `/etc/nsswitch.conf'. The hostfilter module only supports
the `hosts' database.  So you'll want to edit the line that starts
with `hosts:' to look something like:

   hosts:	files hostfilter dns
