Description: NSS module for filtering hostname resolution based on a blacklist.
 This package provides a Name Service Switch module that resolves blacklisted
 hostnames to a configurable (dummy) IP address. It will return 'notfound' on
 non-blacklisted hostnames allowing further modules (configured in
 nsswitch.conf) to resolve them.
