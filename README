This directory contains the 0.1 release of the hostfilter NSS module.

For general building and installation instructions, see the file INSTALL.

The hostfilter NSS module provides a Name Service Switch module that resolves
blacklisted hostnames to a configurable (dummy) IP address. It will return
'notfound' on non-blacklisted hostnames allowing further modules (configured in
nsswitch.conf) to resolve them. For more information on NSS (Name Service
Switch), please consult the GNU C Library manual.

In order to use the module, add the `hostfilter' service to
your `/etc/nsswitch.conf'. The hostfilter module only supports
the `hosts' database.  So you'll want to edit the line that starts
with `hosts:' to look something like:

   hosts:	files hostfilter dns
